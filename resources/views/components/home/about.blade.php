                        I usually introduce myself first as a mathematician and then as a Software developer. <br />
                        I have a Master’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science.  <br />
                        Math has been my love since I know for myself. Numbers, logic and algorithms are something I found common to math and programming and that’s how it came about 
                        that I’ve been doing programming for 15 years.
